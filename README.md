GoStore is your applications data swiss knife
======

GoStore is an application storage tool used to speed up your application development. It makes it easier to mix and match existing nosql/some rdbms* databases like RethinkDb, boltdb, leveldb, riak, mongodb, postgres* etc into your application.
It attempts to create a simple way to use different combinations of storage backends in an api.
The idea is to standardize high level database operations that are common to every application.

*RDBMS support is still experimental

**Features:**
- Support go1.5+
- Generalized api for accessing multiple types of databases
- Uses best practices for manipulating data tailored to each type of database
- Application level filtering for databases that dont support filtering (BoltDB)
- Semantic easily understandable api to perform application store actions

>Still being developed, so the api might change slightly, but don't be afraid to post an issue. I use this in an existing project anyway.

database implementations can be found at [gostore-contrib](http://github.com/osiloke/gostore-contrib)

#### Supported Databases
* [RethinkDB](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb) - Fully Supported

* [BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) - Partially Supported

* [Scribble](https://github.com/nanobox-io/golang-scribble) - Partially Supported

* [Postgres](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) - Experimental

#### Eventually Supported Databases
* CockroachDb
* MongoDB
* Aerospike
* Couch

## Usage

```
$ go get github.com/osiloke/gostore
```

Gostore tries to simplify your database needs by providing simple specific highlevel database actions which are common to most applications. These actions form the api and are listed below

#####Using a store

```go
import (
	"github.com/osiloke/gostore"
)
//Create a rethinkdb backed store called app
store, _ := gostore.NewRethinkObjectStoreAndSession("localhost:28015", "app")

//Now create the db
store.CreateDatabase()

//Create the table you want to use, you can pass an optional schema 
//to do some advanced stuff
store.CreateTable("things", nil)

//now for profit, tables are accessed by name

//Save a thing which returns the stored key
key, _ := store.Save("things", map[string]interface{}{"name":"one thing", "kind": "table"})

//Or just save all things
keys, _ := store.SaveAll("things", []interface{}{
	map[string]interface{}{"name": "First Thing", "kind": "chair"},
	map[string]interface{}{"name": "Second Thing", "kind": "cup"},
})
keys = append(keys, key)
//Now we can retrieve a thing
var thing map[string]interface{}
store.Get(key, "things", &thing)

println(thing)

```

Api
====

####Database Operations

*	CreateDatabase - Creates the database
* 	CreateTable - Creates a table/container/collection in a database
* 	GetStore - This returns a reference to the stores session
*	Stats - Gets some stats on the database
*	Close - Closes the database, essentially closing the session

####Retrieval

*	All 
*	AllCursor
*	AllWithinRange
*	Get

####Creation and Updates

*	Save
*	SaveAll
*	Update
*	Replace
*	Delete

####Filtering

*	Since
*	Before
*	FilterSince
*	FilterBefore
*	FilterBeforeCount
*	FilterUpdate
*	FilterReplace
*	FilterGet
*	FilterGetAll
*	FilterDelete
*	BatchFilterDelete
*	FilterCounts
*	GetByField
*	GetByFieldsByField

## Testing
This project uses goconvey for testing but you can run tests like any other go project

```
go test -v
```

Testing rethinkdb store requires a running rethink server. This will be updated to use a mock rethinkdb in a few days after which this comment will be removed
